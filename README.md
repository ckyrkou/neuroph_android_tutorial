Machine Learning for Android Applications using Neuroph Studio

This project is a step by step tutorial for how to use machine learning algorithms within android using the Neuroph Studio Library and Framework. It contains documents with step by step instructions on how to install the Neuroph software and how to modify the android project to include machine learning and image processing.
The app itself interfaces with the camera of an Android phone and processes the video in real-time to classify it. This particular app uses a neural network that recognizes arrows at different orientations.
The project is implemented using the Android Studio. The Neuroph software is not provided and should be downloaded separately.
